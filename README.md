-----------------------------------------------------------
Hardware:
Parallax RFID Card Reader /w cards (Radio Shack 276-212)
Raspberry Pi (Adafruit 998)
Pi Cobbler (Adafruit 914)
Logic level converter (Sparkfun BOB-11978)

Software:
VMware Orchestrator
VMware vCenter
Tiny python script
-----------------------------------------------------------
This idea simply came from the thought ‘i wonder if it’s possible…’   I’ve always wanted to build something with RFID, and I’ve always wanted to play with a Raspberry Pi, so no time like the present.

The thought here is to simulate swiping your badge at your office in the morning when unlocking the door, and automatically have it wake up your desktop virtual machine so it’s ready for you by the time you need it.
